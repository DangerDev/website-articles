**In this article, I will discuss some ideas how to produce individual angular apps. How do we get one app per customer, if we have 100+ customers?**

<hr>

Recently, I was asked during a workshop how to produce customer-specific angular apps.
My first answer was: "That's easy: `NgModules`!". Isn't it? ðŸ¤”

## Explanation

I asked a little bit more and got the following explanation from the attendee.

* The attendee was asking this question for his current project at his company.
* There is nice a REST-API backend with swagger in place. No work here. Hooray!
* There is a (technically outdated) web-application to provide the UI. They are doing the hosting. 
* Everything should be re-implemented with Angular, of course.
* There are more than, let's say, 100 customers.
* Every customer expects a slightly different solution.

One of the current unique selling points are the specific-apps.
Every customer can purchase a different set of features for different fields of applications. For example, main feature X as well as customer management, debt collection and reports. Bigger customers might also want a full HR solution, and so on. You get the point.

This should be easy to archive, no matter which technical solution is chosen. But it gets a bit more challenging, because some forms are very specific for each customer. For example the 	order acceptance form might have specific controls based on the customers individual demands for an order.

Right now the customer combines Silverlight and MEF. The technology is outdated, but it had some great strengths. It is possible to create a specific app just buy adjusting a configuration file and by throwing the required libraries (DLL) into the right folder. A library is missing, the feature is not shown. A more specific screen overrides the standard screen (.NET reflection involved as far as I know). And it works flawlessly. 

## Requirements

The future product/solution should be...

1. fast, and not bloated with unused code because of conditional statements
2. maintainable, if possible a dedicated build for each customer should be avoided


## Ideas

How could we do the same? Let's collect some ideas:


### 1. One big monolith

The simplest approach. One single software project must be maintained. 
We could use feature toggles (for example [ngx-feature-toggle](https://github.com/willmendesneto/ngx-feature-toggle)) to enable / disable smaller or bigger parts of the application:

```html
<feature-toggle [featureName]="'reports'">
  <p>condition is true and reports are shown here.</p>
</feature-toggle>
```

We could also use `*ngIf` directly, but we would need to add some own boilerplate code around.

**PROS:**

* dead simple
* one workspace* to maintain
* one build to maintain

**CONS:**

* spaghetti code to maintain
* unused code everywhere (bigger bundle sizes, possible interferences everywhere)
* hard/impossible to deliver different versions to different customers (one update for one customer effects all other customers, too)
* just no

_`*` In this article I will use the word "workspace" to describe one Angular-CLI project in one physical folder. I don't want to confuse this with the word "project" in the context of the new multi application/libary support (see below)._



### 2. One fat application, multiple small ones<br>(Extracting everything to NPM packages)

I'm a big fan of Angular-Modules that are compiled and delivered via NPM.
NPM packages have versions and can demand dependencies.
The great thing: the can be hosted privately on [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/private-modules/intro), on [myget](https://www.myget.org/), on your on-premise or cloud [TFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/package/?view=vsts), on [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) and many more!

Before Angular-CLI 6 I was used to [`ng-packagr`](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr). It took me some time, to configure an existing product to work as in the demo [`ng-packaged`](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packaged). But it the end, the work has paid off. Now the Angular CLI workspace file (`angular.json`) supports multiple projects in one folder - which is great! A project can be either an  application or a library (see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/angular-workspace)). The library support works on top of `ng-packagr `.

You can create a library in an existing workspace by running the following commands:

```bash
ng generate library my-lib
```

You should now have a library inside `projects/my-lib`. It contains a component and a service inside a NgModule. Read more about library creation [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library).

We could create one (or more) projects that would contain the ultimate, full-blown app. Every feature would be organised in one NgNodule and would be delivered as one NPM package. Consequently, we would need 100 smaller solutions that compose those NPM packages. We would have one big app and for each customer his own Angular-CLI solution.

**PROS:**

* easy to setup, since there is direct support via Angular-CLI now
* every single solution would be highly customisable 
* the dedicated apps would only contain the code they need, this should lead to small bundle sizes
* **USP:** we could utilise semver versioning to deliver features/patches only to selected applications (and therefore customers)


**CONS:**

* multiple workspaces to maintain (in the worst case it would be 100+1 workspaces)
* multiple builds to maintain
* historically, Angular-CLI and `npm link` were never real friends (see [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3854#issuecomment-274344771), or [here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6195))


### 3. One fat application with multi application support<br>(No NPM packages involved)

Okay, I need to find a better headline! :wink:

This idea is pretty similar to #2. But this time we would utilise multiple apps via `angular.json`. Angular CLI now supports multiple individual applications within one workspace, each with separate configurations and defaults. To create another app you can use the following command:

```bash
ng generate application my-other-app
```

The new application will be generated inside `projects/my-other-app`. Now we can build each application by passing the project name with the command:

```bash
ng build my-other-app
```

Solution #2 was based on the idea of multiple libraries. Now we have multiple apps which derive from the big-fat application. We reduce complexity, since we don't need to publish a big amount of NPM packages around.

**PROS:**

* easy to setup, since there is direct support via Angular-CLI
* tree-shaking should still lead to small bundle sizes
* one workspace to maintain
* one build to maintain (if we build multiple apps in one big build)


**CONS:**


* the one big build will have a very long runtime
* we could not utilise semver versioning to deliver features/patches only to selected applications


### 4. Are there more solutions?

These were my ideas that came into my mind. What do you say? Did I overlooked another way? Please write me a mail (team@angular.schule) or send me a DM via Twitter (@JohannesHoppe). Thanks in advance! :+1:
