**A while ago I had a nice chat with Maxim Salnikov (the founder of @ngCommunity) about the necessary marketing for a technical meetup. He encouraged me to write down my views. Well, let's do that. These are my tips and thoughts for making your Meetup successful.**

## My assumptions

In this text I will serve a number of sterotypes.
Of course I don't have any empirically proven numbers, instead I can only rely on my personal observations.
If I am totally wrong with some assumptions, please write me.
I am looking forward to every hint and would like to learn much more by myself through this article.
If you feel really hurt by any claim, write to me directly and we will clarify this in a private context!


## The typical marketing first

First, one should do their homework.
The name of the Meetups should make it unmistakably clear what we are talking about.
In our case, Angular, what else?
However, no one really does that wrong.
One example: "Angular Nürnberg Meetup".
This will work. (By the way, there is no "Angular Nürnberg Meetup" out there, someone should change that!)
Of course, you need a nice logo, too.

But when it comes to the general Meetup description, you can often optimise things:
What makes the Meetup so special?
Why the hell should I go there and not just watch Netflix instead?
In principle, we humans are pretty lazy and the benefits must exceed the costs, otherwise Netflix is gonna be watched.
This leads us to the various involved parties, which all have different interests and which we should first look at openly.

## Who has what interest?

### 1. The Organizer

First there is you, the Meetup Organizer or the team of organisers.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What is your motivation behind putting all the time into the Meetup and keeping the attendees and the choosy speakers happy?

Some reasons I can think of:

- you want to make yourself or your company name more famous
- you want to socialise to boost your career
- you enjoy bringing people together and like organising events
- you want to sell workshops
- you are a recruiter and you are in need of some new business leads

Your motivation should be clear to you and it also should also be clear to an outsider why you are doing this.
The first three points will probably be considered legitimate by everyone.
However, people will probably get very angry if they realise that you're just trying to sell them something. 
Personally, I was at a meetup that was actually a sales event and I never went back there again.
I'm assuming that I wasn't the only one who didn't like it at all and who will never come back.

So please be honest, it pays off. Don't overdo it with pushing sales, even if it's hard. I know that.

### 2. The attendee

Yeah, the attendee.
This rare species that doesn't want to come when no one else comes.
The one who loves the pack and then often just doesn't come without cancelling or doing it at the last minute. Later in this article I want to discuss why the "now show rate" is usually so high.

Enough with the clichés, what characterises our valuable visitor?

> Warning: As already mentioned, we are focusing here only on Meetups with topics related to computer science.
> And generally I only have a clue how it works here in Germany.


## The length of the event


## Food


## Technical equipment


## Sponsoring


## Reducing the No-Show Rate


## Making everybody happy
