**With version 8.3 of the Angular CLI a new command has been released which has the potential to be a game changer. Now, deployments to any target (Firebase, Azure, Github pages...) are potentially only one CLI command away. In this article we discuss everything you need to know.**

## Introduction

Angular team member Minko Gechev [recently added](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/15105) added a command to the CLI which invokes a so-called __deployment builder__ for a project.
The amount of code added is relatively small, because builders have been around for a longer time and because the CLI itself does not have much to do, but passes the work on to other third-party code.
So it's up to the community to breathe life into the command.
And that's the reason for this article. ðŸ˜€


## Background

In fact, the CLI already has this ability for a while.
Angular CLI allows us to extend the set of functionality by implementing builders and invoking them with `ng run [builder-name]`.
There is a very detailed [article about builders](https://angular.io/guide/cli-builder) provided in the official docs.


But until now deploy commands were not made on top of CLI builders.
Those commands are usually hidden in their own CLI (eg. `firebase deploy`) and have nothing to do with the Angular CLI.
Our own deploy command ([angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages/)) was one of them.
There was simply no requirement for us to implement a deeper integration into the CLI.

All right, until now builders have not yet achieved the necessary attention they deserve.
The new command `ng deploy` is designed to change that!
* it runs in the Angular CLI, so it's clear that an Angular App should be deployed and reasonable defaults can be set accordingly
* it is called `ng deploy` instead of the usual `ng run [builder-name]` which might be confusing otherwise
* it throws a meaningfull message in case there is no deployment builder installed (`Cannot find "deploy" target for the specified project. You should add a package that implements deployment capabilities for your favorite platform.`)
* it has a very short syntax, because by default it will deploy the default project
* **and the most important point:**
  It is an invitation to the community to standardise deployments under the umbrella of the Angular CLI 


## Command Line Call

Let's take a look at the semantics. How is a deploy builder called?

Without any further arguments, the CLI will try to execute the deploy builder for the default project:

```bash
ng d [options]
```

Which is the same as:

```bash
ng deploy [options]
```

As you might know, you can manage several Angular Apps (projects) in one workspace.
The CLI accepts an optional project name, as specified in the `angular.json` configuration file.

```bash
ng deploy --project [PROJECT_NAME] [options]
```

The options are optional.
They will be passed to the deploy target for the selected project. 
So if you have created a project by calling `ng new your-angular-project`, the complete command could be:

```bash
ng deploy --project your-angular-project 
```


## Existing providers

There is already a good adaptation for `ng deploy`.
The following providers are currently available:

* `@angular/fire` (Deployment to [Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting))
* `@azure/ng-deploy` (Deployment to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/))
* `@netlify-builder/deploy` (Deployment to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/))
* `@zeit/ng-deploy` (Deployment to [Now](https://zeit.co/now))
* `angular-cli-ghpages` (Deployment to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/))

In future you should be able to find more providers via the following search:  
https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ng%20deploy

You can try them out by executing the following commands.

1. Install the latest version of the Angular CLI.

   ```sh
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. Run `ng version`, to make sure you have installed Angular CLI v8.3.0 or greater.

3. Update your existing project using the command:

   ```sh
   ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
   ```

4. Add one of the listed providers to your project.

   ```sh
   ng add [provider]
   ```

5. Deploy your project via:

   ```sh
   ng deploy
   ```

One example:

## Deploy to multiple targets

Right now `ng deploy` only support a single deploy target for a project.
If we want to deploy a project to more than one provider, it is necessary to rewrite the `angular.json` file and use the old syntax to execute the builder.

Let's assume you want to use `@angular-schule/ngx-deploy-starter` and `angular-cli-ghpages` together for one project.
First install them via `ng add @angular-schule/ngx-deploy-starter` and `ng add angular-cli-ghpages`.
The last one will override the configuration of the first one.

Now open the `angular.json` file and locate the section `projects > you-angular-project > architect > deploy`.
The trick is to create two sections with different names:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-angular-project": {
      "architect": {
        "deploy-ghpages": {
          "builder": "angular-cli-ghpages:deploy",
          "options": {}
        },
        "deploy-starter": {
          "builder": "@angular-schule/ngx-deploy-starter:deploy",
          "options": {}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "defaultProject": "your-angular-project"
}
```

You can now call up the two builders via the classic approach again:

```bash
ng run your-angular-project:deploy-ghpages
ng run your-angular-project:deploy-starter
```


## How to make your own deployment builder

As a cloud-platform provider (or as a fan of that service), you should consider to implement a dedicated deployment builder.
Let's think about a deployment via FTP, to AWS, to Heroku, to Rackspace etc. â€“ it's up to YOU to launch the next rocket!! ðŸš€ 

So we started a sample project to help on that way.
The groundwork of this starter was provided by Minko Gechev's [ngx-gh project](https://github.com/mgechev/ngx-gh).

This project has the following purposes:

1. To promote the adoption of `ng deploy`.
2. To clarify various questions and to standardise the experience of the various builders.

You are free to customise this project according to your needs.
Please keep the spirit of Open Source alive and use the MIT or a compatible license.


## Summary

With the new deployments, it will be even easier to manage an Angular application over the entire lifecycle.
In addition to code generation, build, testing and much more, we can now also conveniently deploy to any target like Azure, Firebase or Netfly.
More providers should come soon. ðŸš€
