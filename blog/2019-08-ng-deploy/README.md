With version 8.3 of the Angular CLI a new command has been released which has the potential to be a game changer.

# Command Line Call

Let's take we look at the semantics. How is a deploy builder called?

Without any further arguments, the CLI will try to execute the deploy builder for the default project:

```bash
ng d
```

Which is the same as:

```bash
ng deploy
```

As you might know, you can manage several Angular Apps (projects) in one workspace. The CLI accepts an optional project name, as specified in the `angular.json` configuration file.

```bash
ng run [PROJECT_NAME]:deploy
```

So if you have created a project by calling `ng new your-angular-project`, the complete command would have to be:

```bash
ng run your-angular-project:deploy
```

Surprisingly, there are no other standardized options â€“ but we will come back to that in a moment.
